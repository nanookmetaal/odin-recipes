  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1.5 large zucchinis, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>500gr ground beef</li>
    <li>1.5 cups low-carb marinara sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>0.5 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>220 grams ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>0.5 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>0.25 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>aluminium foil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Lightly coat a baking dish with cooking spray. Set aside.</p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>Slice the zucchinis lengthwise into thin strips, about 1/4 inch thick. Lay them on a paper towel and sprinkle with
    1 teaspoon of salt to help draw out moisture. Let sit for about 10-15 minutes, then pat them dry with a paper towel.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook until browned,
    breaking it apart as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</p>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p>Stir in the marinara sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt, oregano, and black pepper into the cooked beef. Simmer for 5-7
    minutes, then remove from heat.</p>

  <h3>Step 5</h3>
  <p>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and ground nutmeg. Mix well until smooth.</p>

  <h3>Step 6</h3>
  <p>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer some
    zucchini slices over the sauce, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture. Sprinkle a handful of mozzarella cheese
    over the ricotta. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of zucchini, meat sauce,
    and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</p>

  <h3>Step 7</h3>
  <p>Cover the dish with aluminium foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or
    until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</p>

  <h3>Step 8</h3>
  <p>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
