  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1.5 kg lamb (cut into medium-sized pieces)</li>
    <li>2 cups basmati or long-grain rice</li>
    <li>3 large carrots (cut into thin sticks)</li>
    <li>2 large onions (finely sliced)</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic (whole, unpeeled)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon coriander seeds</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric (optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 cups water or broth</li>
    <li>1-2 dried chili peppers (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Rinse the rice in cold water several times until the water runs clear. Soak it in warm water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a deep pan over medium heat. Add the lamb pieces and brown them on all sides. This should take about 8-10 minutes.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p>Add the sliced onions to the pot and cook until they are soft and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p>Add the carrots to the pot and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 5</h3>
  <p>Season the mixture with cumin seeds, coriander seeds, turmeric, paprika, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine and cook for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 6</h3>
  <p>Add the whole garlic cloves and dried chili peppers to the pot. Pour in 4 cups of water or broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, partially covered.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 7</h3>
  <p>Spread the soaked rice evenly over the top of the meat and vegetables. Do not stir. Add a little more water if necessary, just enough to cover the rice by about 1 cm. Increase the heat and bring to a boil again.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 8</h3>
  <p>Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot tightly, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and all the water is absorbed.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 9</h3>
  <p>Once cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest, covered, for another 10 minutes.</p>
  
  <h3>Step 10</h3>
  <p>Fluff the rice gently with a fork and serve the lamb plov hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.</p>
