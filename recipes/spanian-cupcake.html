  <p>
    Oi, this ain't your basic cupcake. This is Spanian’s Cupcake, full of mad Spanish flavors like cinnamon, orange
    zest, and almonds. Proper banging.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 big eggs (none of that tiny stuff)</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar (sweet as)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup whole milk (full fat, no weak stuff)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil (straight fire for flavor)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Zest of 1 orange (for that proper Spanish kick)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Powdered sugar for dusting (if you're feeling fancy)</li>
    <li>Slivered almonds for garnish (optional, but makes it look legit)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Fire up the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with some paper liners. No mess.</p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>Grab a big bowl, chuck in the eggs and sugar, and whip that up until it’s looking fluffy.</p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p>Pour in the olive oil, milk, orange zest, cinnamon, almond extract, and vanilla. Stir it up good.</p>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p>In another bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt. Keep it simple.</p>

  <h3>Step 5</h3>
  <p>Slowly mix the dry stuff into the wet mix. Don’t go crazy stirring it or your cupcakes will turn out tough.</p>

  <h3>Step 6</h3>
  <p>Fill up the muffin cups about 3/4 full. If you're feeling extra, throw some almonds on top.</p>

  <h3>Step 7</h3>
  <p>Bake for about 15-20 minutes. Check with a toothpick—if it comes out clean, you’re golden.</p>

  <h3>Step 8</h3>
  <p>Take ‘em out, let ‘em chill in the tray for 5 minutes, then move to a wire rack.</p>

  <h3>Step 9</h3>
  <p>Once they’re cooled down, dust with powdered sugar if you wanna flex. Then smash ‘em.</p>
